# Ai_HUB-API
This API Gives latest AI News and AI Tools.
I used nodejs and express server.
I used puppeteer to scrape data from futurepedia.io website which has infinite scrollling pages.
I displayed the scraped data on two endpoints-> one for LatestAi News and other for LatestAiTools.
Finally for the deployment purpose, I dockerized my backend and deployed it on railway.
Finally published my API on rapidapi.com
